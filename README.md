Building and explaining Machine Learning Models for Sepsis Data

The repository contains code that is used to prepare the models that predict the probability of survival for patients with sepsis. 

The code is used in the article: "Explainable artificial intelligence helps to understand the effect 2 of fibronectin on survival of sepsis" written by: Anna Lemańska-Perek, Dorota Krzyżanowska-Gołąb, Katarzyna Kobylinska, Przemysław Biecek, Tomasz Skalec, Maciej Tyszko, Waldemar Gozdzik, and Barbara Adamik. The article is in review.
